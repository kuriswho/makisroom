          <i><h3>South Korea</h3></i>

          <h2>Day 1</h2>
        </p>
        <p>
          A quick update to let you know I’ve arrived in Seoul safe and well.
          I’d have updated sooner but after 13 hours total on airplanes I really needed to shower and nap.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is without a doubt the fanciest hotel I've stayed in.
          The most notable feature is the space-age toilet, which has a heated seat and can administer an enema or a #
          massage, if that's something that appeals to you.
          I have not tested these features.
        </p>
        <p>
          That’s not to be ungrateful – in fact I’m actually worried about adjusting from this incredible toilet to 
          what will most likely be a hole in the ground in the desert.
        </p>

        <p>
          Before I get some much needed rest, here is the view from the hotel window:

          <h2>Day 2</h2>
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus concludes the Korean portion of our trip.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’m currently in Incheon Intl Airport awaiting the flight to Ulanbataar, and before we lift off 
          I’ll fill you in on what we’ve been doing for the last day and a half.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first thing we did yesterday was visit a Meerkat Café in Seogyo-dong. I know nobody wants to 
          hear me talk about it so I’ll just oblige you all with the pictures I know you really want.
        </p>
        <p>
          <img src="travelimages/seoul/meerkats1.jpg"alt="Meercats sitting in a spacious glass enclosure with coloured foam mats on the floor and a climbing tree" width="800">
          <img src="travelimages/seoul/meerkats2.jpg"alt="Meercats lazing comfortably on soft mats" width="800">
          <img src="travelimages/seoul/meerkats3.jpg"alt="A meercat sitting, legs splayed, looking relaxed" width="800">
        </p>
        <p>
          The meerkats are in a separate pen from the rest of the café but they are not the only animals there, 
          and the main floor is roamed more or less freely by wallabies, cats and a raccoon.
        </p>
        <p>
          <img src="travelimages/seoul/wallabies.jpg"alt="Visitors feeding two wallabies" width="800">
          <img src="travelimages/seoul/raccoon1.jpg"alt="A raccoon sitting atop a plastic slide, holding his own foot and touching his nose to it" width="800">
          <img src="travelimages/seoul/raccoon2.jpg"alt="A raccoon playing with a soft foam ball" width="800">
          <img src="travelimages/seoul/cat1.jpg"alt="A green eyed, striped grey cat with a wiry, elegant frame - it looks vaguely perplexed" width="800">
          <img src="travelimages/seoul/cat2.jpg"alt="A blue eyed, cream spotted cat sitting on a table" width="800">
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to the animals on the main café floor, they had two silver foxes who were brought in from 
          their outdoor enclosure to be hand-fed melon by visitors.
        </p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>
          The staff were very kind and careful with the animals and it was clear that every resident well looked 
          after. The animals had a great relationship with the staff too and it’s obvious that they are dearly 
          loved.
        </p>
        <p>
          Last night we went for a walk through Myeongdong and had a lovely meal of Bibimbap - one of my favourite 
          Korean dishes.
        </p>

        <p>
          We’re still waiting to check in at the airport and our flight isn’t till 7pm local time so presumably
          I’ll be spending the rest of the day scampering around Incheon Int. Airport in my crocs. I’ll hopefully 
          update once I reach Ulanbataar and get settled. Until then, enjoy the meerkats.
