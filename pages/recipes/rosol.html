      <h3>Rosół:</h3>
      <p>I used to make this with my landlord.  It's very cozy.  Depending on how big your pot is and how confident you are that you can lift a few litres of boiling liquid, this recipe may call for a friend.</p>
        
      <p>
        Ingredients: <br>
          <ul>
            <li>1 Whole, raw chicken, sans tits</li>
            <li>4 Carrots, halved lengthways</li>
            <li>2 Large onions, halved</li>
            <li>2 Parsnips, halved lengthways</li>
            <li>3 Celery stalks</li>
            <li>5 Cloves garlic</li>
            <li>2 Bay leaves</li>
            <li>Handful of peppercorns</li>
            <li>A few sprigs each of parsley and dill</li>
            <li>2 tsp ground turmeric</li>
            <li>Polish thin noodles</li>
            <li>A few drops of Winiary Przyprawa liquid seasoning</li>
         </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        Method: <br>
        <ol>
          <li>Put the chicken in the biggest pot in your house and cover with water</li>
          <li>Bring to a boil on the hob and add the carrots, onions, parsnips, celery, and garlic - You can let the chicken simmer first but we were lazy and just threw it all in at once</li>
          <li>Simmer for an hour, skimming regularly</li>
          <li>Add in the peppercorns and bay leaves and simmer for another hour</li>
          <li>Add the turmeric and simmer for a further 15 mins or so</li>
          <li>Strain the broth.  This is a two person job - we recommend fishing for large removable bits first to ease some of the weight.</li>
          <li>Bone the chicken and shred the meat with a fork</li>
          <li>Store the chicken separately and add to the soup when serving</li>
          <li>Separately cook a portion of noodles</li>
          <li>Place noodles into a serving bowl, ladle over plenty of broth</li>
          <li>Add chicken and garnish with parsley and dill</li>
          <li>Season to taste with salt, pepper and Winiary Przyprawa</li>
        </ol>
