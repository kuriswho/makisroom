                Well, S is gone. I'm grieving him, our house, our children and our life together.
            </p>
            <p>
                Reading the most recent entry stings a lot now. I thought I had set my sights low - 
                I didn't think I was hoping for too much but it would have been perfect to me. I thought 
                that finally, God had looked at my life and witnessed my suffering and how hard I had 
                been trying and said "yes, you deserve to have a happy life."
            </p>
            <p>
                I thought the pain I've always felt was finally going to be worth it.
            </p>
            <p>
                I don't understand. I am too small to see God's plan for me but if it's not this, then I 
                don't understand why He placed it before me only to take it all away. If there is some 
                kind of test to be passed, I don't think I'm up to it.
            </p>
            <p>  
                I slit my wrists on Thursday, rather unsuccessfully. I'm moving into homelessness this week 
                and I'm not sure what it will involve.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have always been someone for whom the most vital thing is my sense of home. All I've ever 
                needed is somewhere permanent and private that is entirely my own. I don't need it to be 
                big or beautiful, but I need somewhere that can never be taken away.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is my worst fear on earth and God is going to make me face it. I'm petrified.
            </p>
            <p>
                I've been just awful the last few days. My friends have been so kind and patient and I 
                have been very ungrateful and rude. I don't want the help they can offer. I want my life with 
                S and I want him to be my husband, I want to spend my life raising our children and learning 
                new skills and hobbies together. I want to wake up next to him when I'm 80 and anything short 
                of that is an insult. People have been incredibly generous and I've thrown it back in their faces.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm trying to curb it now, because I love my friends and I've never been someone who gives up 
                easily no matter how much I want to. I'm feeling dreadful right now, but I will try my best to act 
                in a way that would make me proud going forward.  It is insincere for now, but it might not always be.
            </p>
            <p>
                Migrating and making the final site updates before I become homeless.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm frightened, but I'm unable to kill myself so I have no choice but to 
                keep marching forward, not knowing where I'm headed.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'll do my best but I've been doing my best for so long and I'm so tired.
            </p>

            <h4>04.02</h4>
            <p>
                I need something to hope for.  I'm struggling with responsibility, with work and with 
                keeping myself in check socially.  I can't stop making insinuations without grace, 
                because I'm angry and hopeless and frightened.
            </p>
            <p>
                What can I bear to hope for, now?  When I envision an "ideal" future I keep catching 
                myself reeling it back in the name of realism.  I can't dream of a big kitchen because I 
                will never be that wealthy.  I can never dream of high ceilings.  What would I really 
                want, if I was unconcerned with impossibility?
            </p>
            <p>
                I don't know, and I don't know how to find out because it hurts too much, but here's something 
                I could hope for.
            </p>
            <p>
                Myself and S, a living room with a comfortable couch.  Enough counter space that our child (we 
                have a child,) can help me fold dumplings in the kitchen on a weekday afternoon. A bedroom that 
                gets natural light.  Shoes lined up neatly at the door, or in a cabinet.  A neat bathroom.
            </p>
            <p>
                I still cycle and run.  So does he.  We are teaching our child to ride a bike.  We are still in love.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am not such an open wound of a person.  I have enough love and self-respect not to pass down this 
                insecurity to our child.  I seldom worry that I'm messing everything up and would be better off dead.  
                I seldom cry myself to sleep and when I do, S is there and strokes my hair.  I do the same for him, 
                but seldom.  He has enough love and self-respect to understand that he deserves to be here, to be happy.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our child never has to doubt that we care for them.  We have enough money never to have to doubt that 
                we can care for them.  
            </p>
            <p>
                I can walk under a gray sky with my groceries and not wonder if life will always be so hard, if the 
                constant worry is digging trenches into my forehead every waking moment, because the constant worry has gone.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have something that I'm good at, that I trust myself to do consistently and do well.  A well-honed skill.  
                I might work in the field, or I might not.  I'd like to, but I'd like to have had a choice.
            </p>
            <p>
                If I get even half of this my life will have been worthwhile.

        <h4>02.08</h4>
        <p>
            I've been restless and dissatisfied for months and I can't seem to snap out of it, 
            or put my finger on what it is I'm missing.  I feel like a fuck up for what happened 
            with Mk, and although I don't want to go back on setting my boundaries, I feel like 
            even if I did want to I couldn't.  It's strange never knowing how to talk or act 
            anymore.  I don't know how to behave like a sensible adult.  I want to be messy and 
            stupid and childish, but I want also to do the right thing.  I want to tell him how 
            much I care and how much this is hurting me, but that's irresponsible and puts him 
            under pressure and we can't have a healthy household dynamic with that added complication.
        </p>
        <p>
            One thing I hate about how my thoughts work is that it's never enough for me to just 
            experience a situation and have my feelings about it.  I always have to relate it to the 
            world at large, or some greater question of human nature.  I'm never just having a bad day, 
            the world is hurtling towards destruction.  I'm never just feeling lonely — humanity has 
            begun to lose touch and connection is ever more difficult on a global scale.  Put simply, 
            I'm melodramatic.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm still trying to reconcile the tension between my persistent feelings of otherness and my 
            certainly romanticised but also sincere love for other people.  I want more than anything to 
            be at one with humanity and there are times I feel that very deeply, but when I'm with people 
            I usually feel so alienated and unconvincing.  I'm in this constant state of flux and I can't 
            be comfortable anywhere for long.  I guess I'm lucky to have enough time on my hands to take 
            myself apart and reassemble every day or this would be really debilitating.
        </p>
        <p>
            I feel like I keep getting stuck in this abyss of nuance, like I have beliefs but every point 
            of view can be argued and everything is true/untrue some of the time, but that if I don't make 
            sweeping generalisations it becomes impossible to talk about anything in a meaningful way. 
            "This is true, except for when it isn't." Makes me wonder what point there is in saying anything.  
            I've become so tired of hearing people and I hate that because it makes me feel like an asshole, 
            one of those boring misanthropes that thinks it's cool not to care about anything.  That's not me, 
            but I just can't muster the interest lately.  I don't like it at all.
        </p>
        <p>
            I've decided to shit my brains onto the internet for lack of anywhere better to put it that doesn't 
            hurt anyone.  I never intend to hurt anyone, and that's about all I can say for myself right now.
        </p>

        <p>
            My personality seems to change a lot and it frightens me that I don't seem to 
            have any defining traits — I can be very kind but I can also be infinitely cruel 
            in certain circumstances and I tend to cycle wildly between polar opposites of 
            behaviour.
        </p>
        <p>
            I used to worry that this meant I wasn't a real person but rather just the sum of 
            every interaction I've ever had and this was terrifying and dehumanizing for me.
        </p>
        <p>
            Steafan pointed out that maybe not having an eternally consistent personality doesn't 
            mean that I'm fake or non-existent.  It's just a consequence of being a 3-dimensional 
            person and perhaps makes me very real indeed.
        </p>
        <p>
            It's only hitting me now how much this perspective has helped me to relax on my eternal 
            and agonizing (and more tha likely pointless) quest to dissect my intangible self.  
            I've stopped worrying so much about "not knowing who I am" and I've begun to accept that 
            maybe this is all me.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm kind and cruel, driven and lazy, childish and mature and it's all real. Steafan said he 
            sees me as "a glass half-full."
