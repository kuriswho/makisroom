      <h2>Gummo (1997)</h2>
      <div style="text-align: center;"><i>Dir. Harmony Korine</i></div>
      <p>
        What to say about my favourite film of all time?  That counterintuitively, I
        don't like to watch it very often?  I don't need to - each of the vignettes this
        film presents are of sufficient intensity that they are forever burned into my 
        memory.  It's an unforgettable film, whether you enjoy it or not.
      </p>
      <p>
        There's certainly a shock factor for most first-time viewers.  I know when I first
        saw the film, I was struck by the brutality the characters inflicted on themselves 
        and one another.  The rot at the core of the film uncomfortably mirrored something 
        unsettling I have often felt within myself.
      </p>    
      <p>
        I'm fascinated and frightened by the knowledge that through boredom, loneliness, 
        desperation or any human being becomes capable of unspeakable cruelty.  I'm always
        a bit incredulous when I think of all the horrible things I could do (and likely 
        already do without realizing) for my own ends or simply through my own willful 
        ignorance.
      </p>
      <p>
        And yet, director Harmony Korine never condemns his characters or indeed passes any 
        tangible moral judgement - in stark and refreshing contrast with what I am used to 
        seeing in conventional media, he simply allows people to exist as they are.  There 
        is no clumsy, pointed lesson to Gummo.<br>  
        The entire film, off-putting as it may appear, is shot through a lens of love.
      </p>

       In an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klxOzk3hkDo&t=163s">interview</a> I 
        very much enjoy from November 2000, Korine explains to Independent Pictures Marketing 
        Director Reed Martin what I feel sums up the heart of the film.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        "All the characters in my films are beautiful, even the ones that I find
        disgusting, and I don't see any one person as being any one way. I don't think 
        things are as easy and as simple as they are said or shown to be in most films.
        For me it wasn't hard or complex showing the complexity of these characters, of 
        a girl with Downs Syndrome, because her beauty is <em>obvious,</em> and transcendent
        to me.  The idea of "exploitation" means nothing to me."
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Gummo is unapologetic and holds a steady gaze on the realities we might otherwise 
        instinctively recoil from.  It refuses to look away in disgust. In a 1999 
        <a href="http://harmony-korine.com/paper/int/hk/whammo.html">interview</a> with Werner Herzog,
        Korine voices his frustration with some of the filming crew for their complaints about the 
        filming conditions, most notably in residential buildings in Nashville.  The film crew
        demanded protective clothing because of bug infestations and other sanitary concerns,
        and in rebellion Korine himself and his similarly minded cinematographer Jean-Yves 
        Escoffier filmed several scenes in nothing but Speedos and flip-flops.
      </p>

        It's clear then that the creators of Gummo eschewed any separation between themselves and 
        their subject matter. This is anything but a distant and clinical documentary. Cast in 
        20 minutes with individuals selected out of Burger Kings and meat factories, it is an 
        extremely raw, horrifying and beautiful series of vignettes of America's poor, neglected 
        and forgotten. It chooses not to make a spectacle of them, but rather champions and lends 
        them a voice. Korine has made a very arresting film and his unpretentious attitude and 
        sharp sense of humor about it only endear me to it more.
