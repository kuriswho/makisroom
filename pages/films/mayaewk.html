    <h2>Me and You and Everyone We Know (2005)</h2>
    <div style="text-align: center;"><i>Dir. Miranda July</i></div>
    <p>
        Miranda July is no stranger to open confrontation with the awkwardness involved in 
        being human, and her debut major film proves no exception.  She has constructed here
        an endearing cast of lonely, often socially impaired but arrestingly sincere characters 
        whom we follow as they struggle to connect with each other in a meaningful way.
    </p>
    <p>
        July often draws criticism for being unbearably whimsical and insipid, labels which she 
        has noted <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/miranda-july-kajillionaire-profile.html">here</a> 
        seem unshakeable no matter what she does or says.  She leans into this rather than allow 
        it to frustrate her, noting that there is freedom in feedback seeming independent of your 
        actions.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        “I could say, ‘Yeah, I gangbanged,’ and people would still be like, ‘I don’t know. She 
        seems twee.’ It doesn’t really matter what I do, so I feel pretty free at this point.”
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        I beg to differ with this particular perception of July, because although her work is 
        certainly very sweet (albeit in an extremely awkward, uncomfortable way) I think there's 
        an obvious self-awareness to it and a sharp sense of comedic timing that cuts through to 
        the core of what she's trying to say.
    </p>
    <p>
        If my favourite film, <a href="gummo.html">Gummo</a>, takes an unrelenting look at the 
        harsh and repulsive realities of the human condition then this film observes and acknowledges
        that, but answers with hope.  It champions vulnerability and points out that our wretched  
        lives are punctuated by moments of perfect clarity which can be meaningful and hopeful if 
        we allow them to matter to us.
    </p>
    <p>
        July's work feels a continuous embarrassing confession, and how it feels for you will really 
        depend on whether you answer her admission with an empassioned "Oh my God, me too!  I thought
        I was the only one!" or if it fails to land, an unbearable sense of cringe.  It's really a 
        matter of personal taste, but I appreciate July being willing to take that kind of artistic 
        risk.  In any case, it resonates with me.  Worth watching with an open heart.
