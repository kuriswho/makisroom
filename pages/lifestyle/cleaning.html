         <h2>Cleaning</h2>
         <p>
             My philosophy is very simple regarding cleaning.  Little and often makes the job
             easier, and I try to maintain a positive attitude about the task.  Many people may 
             view keeping their home clean as a chore, but for me it is a matter of self-respect.  
             I am a human being and I deserve to live in a clean and comfortable home.  For me it 
             is a means of self-empowerment - I cannot control my social class and I am limited 
             in that I cannot afford an ostentatious house, but I can keep my home clean and tidy 
             and therefore I never feel deprived when living in a small space. In fact, it may be 
             easier to keep well than a larger space.
         </p>
         <p>
             If you can see the virtue of it but dread the process, I hope I can help you find ways 
             to make cleaning easier in this article.  Once you have a routine, it becomes an almost 
             medatative process and can even be enjoyable. I find the process soothing now, especially 
             as I find that the state of my home corresponds quite closely to the state of my brain. 
         </p>
        <h3>Reducing the Workload</h3>
         <p>
             Obviously, prevention is the best cure.  I recommend maintaining a shoes-off rule in your 
             home.  If you live in a western country where this isn't already custom, it can be difficult 
             to implement but I think it's worth insisting on.  Guests can be encouraged by the addition 
             of a seat inside the front door to make shoe removal easier, as well as perhaps some washable 
             guest slippers if your floors get cold.
         </p>
         <p>
             Another easy way to minimize mess is to also minimize what you actually own. There is 
             already plenty online about the practise of Minimalism - I can't stress enough how much 
             it helps to have fewer extraneous possessions to create clutter. Any trinkets I do have 
             I keep behind glass, or in sealed boxes to allow for effortless dusting - all my surfaces 
             are flat and empty, and therefore a quick wipe with a damp cloth will usually be sufficient 
             to remove dust on a daily basis.
         </p>
         <p>
             An area that it is especially important to stay on top of is the shower.  If you have a 
             shower screen, I recommend keeping a squeegee in the shower and using it every time you 
             shower to rinse down the glass and the tiles. A proper weekly clean will be much easier 
             without a build-up of soap scum.
         </p>
         <h3>Where to Invest</h3>
         <p>
             While I wouldn't particularly worry about buying branded cleaning products for surfaces 
             or floors, one place I do recommend splashing out is laundry detergent. Finding a detergent 
             you like which gets things clean in one wash at a lower temperature will pay for itself in 
             laundry bills very quickly.  Other than this, some baking soda, lemon juice, vinegar and a 
             cheap bleach and glass cleaner are usually enough for the average home.
         </p>
         <p>
             One place it will certainly pay off to invest a little extra is your vacuum cleaner.  You 
             will use it almost every day, and an ineffective vacuum can be frustrating as well as hard 
             on your back.  I have had little success with cordless vacuums, even the very expensive ones 
             and so I cannot recommend them.  My own vacuum is a Miele C3 of some sort and has made such 
             a difference to the ease with which I keep my floors clean.  I recommend prioritizing suction 
             power and parts durability when looking for a vacuum cleaner.  Make sure also to adjust the 
             stem according to your height so that your back remains straight when vacuuming.
         </p>
         <h3>Areas Not to Forget</h3>
         <p>
             <ul>
                 <li>Clean your dish drainer and underneath it at least once a week</li>
                 <li>Wipe dust from radiators, especially if you use them to dry your clean clothes</li>
                 <li>Change out your household textiles (towels and sheets) at least once a week</li>
                 <li>Skirting boards can gather dust - wipe them with a damp cloth</li>
                 <li>Pull out large furniture and vacuum under it regularly - you never know what lost items you might recover</li>
                 <li>A thorough weekly clean of the inside of the microwave is a must to avoid a fire hazard</li>
                 <li>If your hob has a splashback (i.e. against a wall) the wall will need to be cleaned regularly to avoid dust clinging to grease as this becomes impossible to remove</li>
                 <li>Clean your fridge regularly and remove any gone-off food. A dirty fridge is less effective at keeping things fresh.</li>
             </ul>
         </p>
         <h3>Things to Avoid</h3>
         <p>
             <ul>
                 <li>
                     Never put dishes back into the cupboard unless they are properly cleaned and dry 
                     - dirty dishes stacked with clean ones mean they are all unclean, and they will 
                     also make the shelves sticky.  This is very unhygenic.
                </li>
                <li>I shouldn't have to say this but please don't allow your pets onto the kitchen counters!</li>
                <li>Do not leave anything in the sink (kitchen or bathroom) when you're finished - build-up is tougher to remove</li>
                <li>Try not to put things off until later - your future self will thank you for not allowing work to pile up</li>
            </ul>
         </p>
