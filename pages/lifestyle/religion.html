        <h2>Religious Philosophy</h2>
        <p>
            It feels a little strange to put something as important to me as Religion in 
             a relatively minor subcategory, but I would like to keep this site as a place 
             where as many people as possible can find something of value and I understand 
             that Religion can be a very contentious topic. Therefore I will say my piece 
             here simply because it's an area I'm navigating for the first time and I want 
             to keep a record of my thoughts as they come.  If you disagree that's perfectly 
             alright. It changes very little for me.
        </p>
        <p>
             I was not raised in a religious family, and received no formal religious education. 
             I did not take part in the religious practices of my community - in fact, I don't 
             really have a religious community at all.  Therefore it was quite a surprise to me 
             to discover in my early twenties that I am a Christian.
        </p>
        <p>
             I began believing in God when I was around 7 years old, but my conception of God 
             was much less defined. The belief was the result of a moment I recall very clearly 
             of lying in bed, stricken with some age-appropriate terror and feeling compelled 
             somehow to pray.  I did pray to God to save me, and was immediately overcome by a 
             sense of comfort comparable only to a chemical hit. To this day, God mostly speaks 
             to me in feelings like this moreso than words.
        </p>
        <p>
             In my adolesence it was easy to push this memory of my first experience with God from 
             my mind and I went through several phases, as most kids do. Shallowly conceptualized 
             teenage Bhuddism, aggressive and confrontational atheism and a nihilistic, defeatist 
             branch of agnosticism - which I so charmingly referred to as "apathetism" were among 
             the most memorable. 
        </p>
        <p>
             However, as I grew into adulthood and my situation became less stable, I became less 
             and less able to ignore the presence of God in my life. As an uncertain young adult 
             I began to conceptualize my God as a very general sort of feautureless force - an orb 
             of ...something, with no face, no gender, no form.
        </p>
        <p>
             I still conceive of God in this way in a general sense - more on this later. However, 
             I have found that the Christian God resonates with me in a way that makes me quite 
             certain that this is my God - the one who reached out to me as a frightened child and 
             who still touches my life as an often frightened adult.
        </p>
        <p>
             How then can I reconcile this with belief also in a formless and omnipresent entity? 
             I have a philosophy around it which developed organically, but which I later found 
             reflected in the Pluralist writing of <a href="http://www.philosopherkings.co.uk/hickandpluralism.html">John Hick</a>
             In  essence, I believe that there is one God, one universal force, who appears to 
             all people in the way that they can most easily understand. It makes sense therefore, 
             that many people would gravitate towards the dominant religion of their culture.  I find 
             cynicism to the familiar tune of "well isn't it convenient that the one true religion is 
             the one your parents taught you?" quite useless and misguided for this exact reason. An 
             all-knowing and ever-present God who wants a loving relationship with us will of course 
             effortlessly embody the frameworks we have already been given.
        </p>
        <p>
             Obviously, there are exceptions. As I've mentioned I was not raised religiously and in 
             fact I have not told my family that I am a Christian as I know they will not respond 
             with grace. For many people, the religious framework (or lack thereof) that they were 
             born into does NOT make sense to them, and I believe that God sees and understands this. 
             Therefore, many people do find God later in life, or convert to a different religion.
             If we are to talk about "one true religion," I think it can only exist for an individual 
             but that that individual can of course be part of a relatively homogenous group.
